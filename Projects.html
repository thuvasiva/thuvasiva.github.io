                <h3>Pointless Quiz Program</h3>
                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <p>As part of my Procedural Programming module at university, I programmed a quiz
                   based on pointless by the BBC, which uses the procedural programming paradigm.
                   There is a literate document, explaining the code in detail below, which can be downloaded or
                   viewed in the pdf viewer.

            <h4>Video</h4>
            <p>Here is a video showing my project in action in a computer terminal. The user selects the play option, then loads a 
                ready made file called Bank1.txt (although more can be made at the user's wish using selection A). Then the user chooses
                the number of people to play. Finally, the quiz questions are asked, with a results table at the end.

                <h3>Football Tilt Game</h3>
                <h4>Explanantion</h4>
                <p>Before coming to university, in my own time, I had a go at creating my own game on the
                   Unity game engine. It gave me my first insights into game development and programming.
                   Through the help of Unity Tutorials I managed to complete this project.
                   The idea of the game is that the user tilts a ball through a series of posts on a virtual football
                   pitch in the shortest time possible.

                <h4>Explanation</h4>
                <p>As part of my object oriented programming module I created a stock market simulator application. A picture of this is below.</p>
