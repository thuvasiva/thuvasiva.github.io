            <p>Hello, I am Thuvaragan, a Bsc Computer Science student at Queen Mary University of London. 
                I have had an interest in programming since my secondary school days and have had a go at various programming tasks ranging from exercises on projecteuler.net to attempting at making a game
                on the Unity game engine.
                Now that I am at university, I am building on my previous programming and general computing knowledge, through completing Computer Science modules.
                Although, I have no specific career path set at the moment, I aim to work hard in all modules I undertake, to end up working in a code development-related field.
                Being in the field of Computer Science, in my opinion, is exciting, as the technology sector is growing everyday, whether it is the gaming field or another field such as AI and look forward to
                being involved.
            </p>
