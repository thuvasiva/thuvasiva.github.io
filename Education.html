                    <p> 
                    In Secondary School I was part of the Sai School Team, an organisation aiming to
                    raise money for children in India, through conducting regular events.
                    I was involved in the running of these events such as an
                    in school FIFA tournament. Specifically, I was given the role of running one classroom hosting
                    the FIFA tournament. I think being involved in running a tournament helped with my organisational skills, 
                    as I had to be prepared to set everything up on time and run the event smoothly.

                    <h3>Pharmacy Work Experience</h3>
                    <p>In 2018, I worked for a week at a local pharmacy and was involved in a number of jobs, such as communicating
                        with customers when they had queries and stacking shelves. I through this, managed to experience a 5 day working week for the first time
                        and helped improve my communication skills.
